With 25 years in mathematics education and financial leadership, I’m completing a Master’s in Analysis & Modelling of Data & Processes as well as IBM’s Data Science Certificate, ready to pivot into Data Science. This has led me to work on hands-on projects using R, Python, SQL, and Excel. I bring a unique mix of analytical depth, cross-functional collaboration, and a love for problem-solving. After managing multi-million euro budgets and teaching complex maths, I am looking forward to transitioning into data science to turn messy, real-world data into clear, actionable insights. I’m also active in nonprofit leadership and public speaking, committed to using data—and storytelling—to make a difference.
