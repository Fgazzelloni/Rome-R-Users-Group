[Federica Gazzelloni](https://federicagazzelloni.com/) Lead Organizer. I am an independent researcher passionate about data science, with a background in actuarial statistics and expertise in collaborative environments. My journey extends from traditional actuarial work to advanced data science with R. As the lead organizer of R-Ladies Rome and Rome R Users Group, I advocate for inclusivity and knowledge-sharing, hosting various events promoting the R language but not limited to. I am also a book club facilitator with the DSLC (former R4DS) online community, fostering collaborative learning. Additionally, I have contributed as a reviewer to global health initiatives, emphasizing accessible learning and effective communication. (September 2025 to Present)
